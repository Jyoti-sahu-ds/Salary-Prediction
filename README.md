# Salary-Prediction
# Business Problem
An employee's compensation is arguably one of the most crucial elements in hiring and job retention. Companies that compete in the same industry should always establish a benchmark for how much they should pay for available positions within their own organizations. In turn, this enables them to keep their workers and compete for talent in both their own industries and in those of other industries. The goal of this project is to analyze a set of job ads and their associated salaries in order to forecast salaries for a subsequent set of job postings. This might be helpful in arbitrating salaries using machine learning algorithms that would forecast those values, as one example salary prediction project.
